# Firewall Log Analyzer
This log analyzer is a command line analyzer that requires the user to enter a filename to be parsed, an action to be chosen, and allows for optional country code for extra filtration. The header will include the action number, event time, action taken, source IP, IPv4 address class, and source country.
